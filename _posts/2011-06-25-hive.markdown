##Hive?
Hive is a framework based on the idea that custom web applications are better for users than pre-canned ones. It gives you the tools for your team to be more productive using it than one-size-fits-all solutions. Hive is built on nodejs and takes less than 2 minutes to setup (including installing node).

##Dependency
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org) 0.4.8 or higher
* [npm](http://npm.org)

In order to run hive projects you will need [node.js](http://nodejs.org). Until version 1.0 of node, I recommend installing [node.js](http://nodejs.org) from source. You can get the install guide [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation).

Installing ```npm``` is simple. If you don't have ```npm``` you can get it [here](http://npmjs.org/).

On **OSX** you can get the installer [here](https://sites.google.com/site/nodejsmacosx/), which includes node and npm.


##MongoDB
If you want to use hive's native database syncing capabilities you'll need a MongoDB server, either locally or hosted by a service. If you are trying to hack out something quickly, I suggest signing up for a [MongoHQ](https://mongohq.com/signup) account, its free and lets you get started rather quickly.

##Install
 Once you have that installed, in ```~/``` you can run:

	npm install hive

This will install the library and CLI.

##Hello World
To quickly create a new project, you can use the hive CLI. To create a project called Hello World in your current directory, run the following:

	hive new hello-world

This will create a folder in your current directory containing your project. To run your project change directories into the created folder and run hive.

	cd hello-world
	hive

Now you should see hive loading all of your project files and a url where you can preview the project.
